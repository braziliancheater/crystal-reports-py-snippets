if you wanna make use of the CrystalRunTime object, you must have sap crystal reports runtime engine **(32 bits)** i wasn't able to run anything related to that obj using the 64 bit version...<br>
that also means you must have python 32 bits in order to run any of that code, or else<br><br>

<br>class not registred error will pop up
<br>
## obs
i also had some problems with an old ibm db2 database needing an odbc connection in order to open the .rpt it would just error out in the terminal... so if you have any problems with that, it may be a good ideia to make one.
